## About me
I build end-to-end web applications and enjoy working across the stack ‚Äî from UX and frontend to backend services and deployment automation.  
My focus is on reliability, maintainability and shipping features that solve real problems. I like using **Spring** for robust Java backends, **Go** for fast systems tools/services, and **Next.js** for modern frontend experiences.
